## Day 6 - April 9, 2020

**Learned how getters and setters work in ES6**

https://coryrylan.com/blog/javascript-es6-class-syntax

**getters**
Instead of `bob.name()` you would call just using `bob.name`

**setters**
Instead of `bob.name('sarah')` you would set the property as `bob.name = 'sarah'`

You do not invoke getters and setters using parethesis.
I am assume this is all ES6 syntatic sugar.

**Learned about what a **Service Layer** is**

We have M V C - which stands for Model View Controller
Model - Deals with Data
View - How things are displayed on the web
Controller - The connections between how both of these modules connect with one another.

You create Service Layers when you have business logic that does fit neatly in any of these three layers. It is another way of encapsulating your data.
